# Express React Project

### What I did? (get set up by connecting a React front-end to a Node or Express back-end)

- Created this Back-end server with express
- Created this Front-end with ReactJS
- In Back-end I set up a back-end api that returns a list of users and what we wanted to do was show those users on the front-end which in React 
- And to show them on the front-end we first set up a proxy in our package.json file on the front-end 
- And then used the useEffect hook to fetch api and then store the data that the back-end returned using the useState hook 
- And then display the data
